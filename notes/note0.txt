* Hit shot percentage: hit * 100 / fired
* Hyperspace
* Ship collisions with rocks
* Change the way smaller rocks are spawned to account for the parent rock vector and velocity
* Game over display
* Title screen with rocks drifting in the background
* Clean up rock spawn code. Conndense to a more generic method instead of one for each rock size
* Bullets handle collisons with rocks and call methods on the rocks. Should this be reversed?
	Yes. Move bullet collision handling to the Rock and UFO objects, let them call
	event_user(0) on the bullet instance for housekeeping. This was really apparent when
	trying to add code to the UFO to determine if the collision was with a bullet so that
	the player score could be modified. Don't want the player getting points for suicidal
	UFOs.
* Implement UFO shooting and collisions
* Sounds! pew! pew! BOOOooommm! 'casue space! pewpew added 20170806
* New font for scores
* Hit shot percentage bonus to score? 100 * hit shot percentage?
* Clean up sprite rendering as it looks sloppy. New sprites? Overlooked options to improve?
* UFO spawn change needs addressing. Fresh UFOs are currently popping almost immediately on
	destruction of their predecessor.
